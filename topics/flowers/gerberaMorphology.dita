    <title>Gerbera Morphology</title>
    <body>
        <p>Gerbera species bear a large capitulum with striking, two-lipped ray florets in yellow, orange, white, pink, or red colors. The capitulum, which has the appearance of a single flower, is actually composed of hundreds of individual flowers. The morphology of the flowers varies depending on their position in the capitulum. The flowers can be as small as 7 cm (<b>Gerbera mini 'Harley'</b>) in diameter or up to 12 cm (<b>Gerbera ‘Golden Serena’</b>).</p>
