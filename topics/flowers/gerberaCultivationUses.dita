    <body>
        <p>Gerbera is very popular and widely used as a decorative garden plant or as cut flowers. The domesticated <xref keyref="cultivar" format="dita">cultivars</xref> are mostly a result of a cross between <b>Gerbera jamesonii</b> and another South African species <b>Gerbera viridifolia</b>. The cross is known as <b>Gerbera hybrida</b>. Thousands of cultivars exist. They vary greatly in shape and size. Colors include white, yellow, orange, red, and pink. The center of the flower is sometimes black. Often the same flower can have petals of several different colors.</p>
